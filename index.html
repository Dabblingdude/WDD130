            <p>Hello! I am Sophomore pursuing a major in Psychology 
                and a minor in Computer Science. I like to play all types 
                of games, whether board games, video games, sports, I enjoy it all. </p>
            <p>While I am not pursuing a career in coding or technology, it is 
                one of my passions and I would like the knowledge and experience 
                in my back pocket just in case.</p>
            <p>I have been blessed to have been a member of The Church of Jesus 
                Christ of Latter Day Saints all of my life! One of my favorite 
                scriptures from the Book of Mormon is Ether 12:27, "And if men 
                come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto 
                men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient 
                for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble 
                themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak 
                things become strong unto them."</p>
