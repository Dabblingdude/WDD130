                <h4>Do you find yourself having a hard time keeping yourself on track? Maybe there are so many impending deadlines approaching that you just can’t keep track of them all and accidentally let a few slip between the cracks. This is no surprise as today’s world is full of distractions, and a need for instant gratification, as well as inadvertently encouraging bad habits like “doom scrolling”. It can be hard to focus on what needs to be done, and it is most likely that you were never taught how to. If that is true for you, you are in the right place! Leave the past in the past, you can’t control that now. But you can control how you approach your future, and you can be confident in that approach if you apply the techniques we teach here at the Time Management and Productivity Place!</h4>
