      <p>
        Do you find yourself having a hard time keeping yourself on track? Maybe there are so many impending deadlines approaching that you just can’t keep track of them all and accidentally let a few slip between the cracks. This is no surprise as today’s world is full of distractions, and a need for instant gratification, as well as inadvertently encouraging bad habits like “doom scrolling”. It can be hard to focus on what needs to be done, and it is most likely that you were never taught how to. If that is true for you, you are in the right place! Leave the past in the past, you can’t control that now. But you can control how you approach your future, and you can be confident in that approach if you apply the techniques we teach here at the Time Management and Productivity Place!

      <h3>Time Management</h3>
      <p>
        Welcome to Time Management!
      </p>
      <p>
        Here we teach 4 versatile strategies that will help you understand more about how you spend your time and effective ways of managing it. We teach the Pomodoro Technique, Stephen Covey’s time matrix, the Eisenhower Matrix, and Time Blocking.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pomodoro Technique: The Pomodoro Technique finds the balance between staying on task, and taking healthy breaks. The process is simple and is shown in the illustration. Once you have selected your desired task, set a timer for 25 minutes. During that 25 minutes, focus on the task and give your full effort until the timer goes off. Then set a timer for 5 minutes and take a quick break. 
        It is recommended that you do something that you enjoy and that recharges you. Oftentimes, that does not look like scrolling through short videos on social media which can suck energy away and numb you out. Something healthier could look like meditating, playing a simple game, or having a quick snack while away from a screen. 
        After the 5-minute break is over, return to your task for another 25 minutes. Repeat this 4 times, so 4 work sessions and 4 short breaks. After the 4th repetition, take a 15-30 minute break, then do it all again as long as you need.
        And there you have it, that’s the Pomodoro Technique!
      </p>
      <p>
        Stephen Covey’s time matrix: Stephen Covey is the author of the renowned book The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. In his book, he shares this matrix: image
        You write out the tasks for the day, week, month, etc., and then determine for each whether they are urgent or not, and important or not.
        Quadrant I is for items that are Urgent & Important. Tasks on your list that you need to get done soon. Imagine that you are a fire fighter and each of these items are fire you need to put out. You will likely be effective but stressed as well due to the impending deadlines and other pressures. You get things done, but not necessarily optimally.
        Quadrant II is for items that are Not Urgent but Important. Tasks on your list that you need to get done, but not necessarily soon. You can take your time and be sure that your work is quality because you don’t have to rush too much. You will be most effective and not burdened with stress from any impending deadlines or other pressures. You get things done optimally.
        Quadrant III is for items that are Urgent & Not Important. Tasks that you do not need to do, but have deadlines. These are best described as distractions because they take you away from tasks that actually do matter.
        Quadrant IV is for items that are  Not Urgent or Important. Tasks that aren’t pressing and bear little to no value in doing. These are essentially Time Wasters as, like the distractions, they take you away from what matters most.
        Optimally, you spend most of your time in Quadrant II. This helps you stay on top of tasks while still a healthy distance away from deadlines. It lets you do more quality work and puts less pressure on you. This will also keep you away from Quadrant I because, in a sense, you can nip most of the Quadrant I tasks in the bud before they become urgent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eisenhower Matrix: The Eisenhower Matrix follows the same idea and pattern as the time matrix but shifts it to more specifically apply to work-based situations. It also adds some direction for what to do for tasks in each quadrant as shown here:
        Do	These are tasks with deadlines or consequences
        Decide (Schedule)	These are tasks with unclear or far deadlines that contribute to long-term success. Here, you set aside time in the future for this task to be done, not letting it be forgotten, but also not letting it take precedence over items in the Do section.
        Delegate	These are tasks that must be done but don’t require your skill set. The task may be delegated to someone more appropriately suited to handle the task.
        Delete		These are distractions and other unnecessary tasks. In other words Quadrant III & IV tasks from the time matrix.

        Unlike the time matrix, Quadrant II, or Decide, is not the quadrant we want to be in. Rather, effectively sorting out tasks into these 4 sections and acting on the items to schedule, delegate, and delete enables you to focus on your priorities here and now, and helps you prepare for future priorities. When applying this as a student or in any other capacity where delegating isn’t an option, simply merge the do and delegate sections.
      </p>
      <p>
        Time blocking: This strategy is essentially employing the use of a calendar in your day-to-day workloads. This can be done using a calendar app, or a physical planner as well. Spend some time scheduling out tasks you want to get done or put progress into, and assign them chunks of time that you will spend focusing on them. In the best-case scenario, using the matrixes helped you decide what the priorities of your to-do list are, so you can assign them the time they need without being distracted by items of lesser importance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stephen Covey’s time matrix, the Eisenhower Matrix, and Time Blocking can even be combined. Remember that the matrixes help you evaluate the importance of tasks, and when combined with Time Blocking, they help you set proper times in your calendar for each item on your to-do list. They do this in a way that prioritizes the most important items, ensuring that you have ample time available to do what you need to do. There are a lot of possibilities in how you can combine these approaches to get that effect, and the most effective approach for each person usually involves applying various strategies in a unique way that works for you. So feel free to experiment and try out new balances.
